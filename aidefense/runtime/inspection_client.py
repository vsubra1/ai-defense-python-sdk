    Abstract base class for all AI Defense inspection clients (e.g., HTTP and Chat inspection).

    This class provides foundational logic for SDK-level configuration, connection pooling, authentication,
    logging, and retry behavior. It is responsible for initializing the runtime configuration (from aidefense/config.py),
    setting up the HTTP session, and managing authentication for API requests.

    Key Features:
    - Centralizes all runtime options for AI Defense SDK clients, such as API endpoints, HTTP timeouts, logging, retry logic, and connection pooling.
    - Handles the creation and mounting of a configured HTTPAdapter with retry logic, as specified in the Config object.
    - Provides a consistent authentication mechanism using API keys via the RuntimeAuth class.
    - Precomputes a default set of enabled rules for inspection, including entity types only for rules that require them (PII, PCI, PHI).

    Usage:
        Subclass this client to implement specific inspection logic (e.g., HttpInspectionClient, ChatInspectionClient).
        Pass a Config instance to apply consistent settings across all SDK operations.

    Args:
        api_key (str): Your AI Defense API key.

    Attributes:
        default_enabled_rules (list): List of Rule objects for all RuleNames. Only rules present in DEFAULT_ENTITY_MAP (PII, PCI, PHI)
