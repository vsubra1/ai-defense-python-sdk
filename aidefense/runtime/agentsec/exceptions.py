    Base exception for all agentsec errors.
    
    All agentsec-specific exceptions inherit from this class,
    allowing users to catch all agentsec errors with a single except clause.
    
    Example:
        try:
            agentsec.protect()
            # ... use protected clients ...
        except AgentsecError as e:

class ConfigurationError(AgentsecError):
    """
    Raised when agentsec configuration is invalid.
    
    This exception is raised during protect() initialization
    if configuration parameters or environment variables are invalid.
    
    Example:
        try:
            agentsec.protect(retry_total=-1)  # Invalid!

    Raised when input validation fails.
    
    This exception is raised when invalid input is passed to
    inspection methods (e.g., empty messages, invalid metadata).
    
    Example:
        try:
            inspector.inspect_conversation([])  # Empty messages!

    Raised when the inspection API times out.

    inspection API request times out.

    Raised when a network error occurs during inspection.
    
    This exception is raised when fail_open=False and a network
    error occurs while connecting to the inspection API (e.g.,
    connection refused, DNS resolution failure).
    
    Example:

class SecurityPolicyError(AgentsecError):
    """
    Raised when a security policy blocks a request or response.
    
    This exception is raised in enforce mode when an LLM request/response
    or MCP tool call violates security policies.
    
    Attributes:
        decision: The Decision object that triggered this error
        message: Human-readable description of why the request was blocked
    
    Example:
